  ## Description
  Often, it is necessary for non-coders to access databases. In these instances it is important to have a user-friendly interface that will allow them to interact with the database through SQL. This command line interface is designed to make it easier for non-coders to access a company's list of departments, positions, and employees. It also allows them to add new departments, positions, and employees, and it allows them to edit existing employees.
